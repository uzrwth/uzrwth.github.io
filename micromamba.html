<h1 align="center">using micromamba</h1>
<hr/>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few days ago, when I finished
the assignment from the IDS course, I upgraded my system.
Python was unintentionally upgraded also. After that, I
found that the virtual environment that I created with old
Python no longer worked.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then I did some research and
tried to use pyenv. However, pyenv is still too intrusive
for me and it won’t help saving me from the broken
virtual environment.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then I learnt about micromamba.
It does seem that micromamba offers a promising solution. I
can created different environments with different Python
versions and export the environment.yml file. With this file
alone, anyone is able to recreate the environment I setup on
my machine.</p>
