Euclidean space

有没有必要研究三维以上的空间？

Actually, the language of n-space makes many complicated situations much easier to comprehend.

对待n-space的态度应该是以它为工具，解决问题，欣赏它的魅力。


# Direct theorems in arbitrary Banach spaces

Using the concept of the 𝞮-entropy of a compact set (section 3.1.3), it is possible to make more precise the theorem derived in section 2.5.1.
