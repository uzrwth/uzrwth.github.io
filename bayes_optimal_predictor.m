What is Bayes predictor?

What is the optimal performance, regardless of the finiteness of the training data? In other words, what should be done if we have a perfect knowledge of the underlying probability distribution of the data? This is what we learn in decision theory: loss, risk, optimal predictors. What is the optimal prediction and performance given infinite data and infinite computational resources?

What is Bayes classifier?

What is Bayes risk?

What is the connection between the squared loss function and Bayes predictor?

What does this mean? "Clearly, we cannot hope that the learning algorithm will find a hypothesis whose error is smaller than the minimal possible error, that of the Bayes predictor."
